# A Game of Tenzies

Made Tenzies using React and vanilla css since the styling was light
- Win by getting all ten die to be the same (hence tenzie)

Functions
- Roll
- Hold Die
- Win / Reset (comes with some cool confetti)
- Local Storage for best record (could do firebase as well but not worth it)

Time to Build from Scratch: ~ 1 hour 45 min
